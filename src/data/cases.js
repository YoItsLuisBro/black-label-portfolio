      "A brutalist to-do + focus timer app that organizes tasks into TODAY / THIS WEEK / DUMPING GROUND, with loud status tags (OVERDUE / DO IT NOW / DONE) and a no-nonsense focus engine.",

      "Shipped a deployed MVP with Supabase email/password authentication + session persistence and a lane-based task workflow (move between columns, overdue/urgent/done labeling, destructive delete modal). Added an adjustable MM:SS timer panel with start/pause/reset and an end-of-timer prompt designed to push focus.",

      "Shipped a deployed MVP on Vercel with Supabase-backed persistence and auth-ready architecture. Implemented core create/read/update/delete flows, workspace-based organization, and filtering so users can quickly find and manage saved items. Designed a harsh, neo-brutal interface with high-contrast typography and direct action patterns.",

Added strict-mode typing (mistakes block forward progress), full run stats (WPM/accuracy/errors/time/score/combo/multiplier), multiple modes (TRACE/ICE/UPLINK/PASS/AUTO), plus local bests + settings pages and optional Web Audio beeps with a SOUND toggle.",
